# optim mdnewton-Calculates the location and maximum value of a multi-dimensional function
# using the Newton approach. Inputs are the multi-dimensional function (anonymous), gradient
# of function (anonymous), Hessian of function (anonymous),initial step size, maximum number
# of iterations, and maximum relative error. The output are the location and maximum value.
