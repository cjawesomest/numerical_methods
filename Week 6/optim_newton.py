# • optim newton-Finds the maximum of a one-dimensional function between two bounds using
# Newton’s approach. The inputs are the first and second derivatives of the function(anonymous),
# lower and upper bounds, maximum number of iterations, and the maximum relative error.
# The outputs are the location of the maximum and the maximum value
